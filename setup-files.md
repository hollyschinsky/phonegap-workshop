title: Module 3&#58; Setting Up the Workshop Files
---
## Steps

1. Delete the contents of your project's **workshop/www** folder.

1. Download the supporting files for this tutorial [here](https://github.com/hollyschinsky/phonegap-workshop/archive/master.zip), or clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/hollyschinsky/phonegap-workshop
    ```

1. If you downloaded the zip file, unzip it anywhere on your file system.

1. Copy the contents of **starter-www** into your project's **workshop/www** folder. Be sure to keep your project folder name **www**.


1. Build and test your application: 
    - If you have a Mobile SDK installed on your system repeat the steps in Module 2. 
    - If you don't, simply open **www/index.html** in a browser on your computer.

1. Type a few characters in the search box to search speakers by name. Clicking a list item doesn't produce any
 result at this time.


> Part-by-Part solutions are available in the **solutions** directory under phonegap-workshop. The www-final folder contains the final
project with polish (Module 14).
